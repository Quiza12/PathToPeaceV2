        #yesmeansyes

        I had been out all night for a friend’s birthday and I decided I was going to walk back to my boyfriend’s house. He had a few mates over so I was going to go back and keep drinking with them. I started walking around back streets when I noticed a car pulled over. Instantly I started to get nervous but told myself it was fine. I started walking faster when the driver put his window down. “Want to come for a drive?” He asked but I straight away said no and kept talking. He then asked me again and I didn’t reply and kept walking faster. He sped forward and stopped when he was next to me again. “Show me what is under your skirt,” he said. I then began running towards my boyfriends house and called him while running telling him to come out the front and that I’d be 2 minutes and that a guy in a car was trying to get me into it. I hung up and kept running when I turned my head to see if the guy in the car was still pulled over, and he was. I kept running when I heard a car flying up towards me and suddenly stopped just ahead of me. He did a quick U-turn and parked on the other side and started yelling at me to get in the car. I shouted “No!” at him and didn’t look back and just ran to my boyfriends’ house terrified.

        When I got to his house I grabbed him and said “let’s just get inside quickly”. I ran in and shut the door behind him, freaking out that the driver had followed me. All of my boyfriends’ mates were sitting around and started asking me what was wrong and why I looked so scared. Once I caught my breath I started telling them what happened, while shaking. Once I stopped they all looked at each other and started laughing saying that I was overreacting, exaggerating the story, that he probably just wanted my phone number and that I should have just done what he said. They even said it could have been a free Uber ride and then began making more jokes about it for the rest of the night.
        
        They haven’t heard the countless stories from countless friends who have all experienced more than once, some sort of sexual harassment, abuse and/or sexual assault.

        #yesmeansyes

        Sexual Assault has been something which I have experienced personally multiple times, and something which many women and men I know have also dealt with.

        My personal experiences occurred mainly from the ages of 15-17, a very vulnerable age in which individuals began sexualising me. Being catcalled by men twice my age was very confusing and confronting. There were individuals who would take advantage of me, take advantage of my vulnerability. There was the individual who wanted more than a conversation, the individual who thought that due to his position of authority he could get away with it, and finally, the individual I was in a relationship with. I don’t want to focus on the acts, as honestly, the acts weren’t the most harmful part for me. I believe that the most harm came from the after effects. Not many people talk about what happens after the assault, the shame you feel, the insecurity, the questioning of who is trustworthy and who isn’t. For me personally, the feeling of being taken advantage of, and the question of what happens next, were the hardest part.

        Although these experiences may be negative, they have taught me some significant lessons. Some years later, I have learnt that with time, the right help, support and awareness, things do truly get better.
        Education in this specific area is especially important, and hopefully with more awareness comes support for those who have experienced or are experiencing sexual assault.

        #yesmeansyes

        I was on a trip with 3 of my other friends in the second half of last year. We had been out drinking for most of the day, but we had come home and had some dinner and sobered up. A couple of the girls decided they wanted to go to the bar at the hotel where we were staying. We went to the bar, had a few drinks. While this was happening, one friend and I were sitting down by ourselves chatting, while the other two were playing pool. Two males approached them and struck up a conversation, and the two guys invited us all back to their room to play board games. I personally didn’t want to go, but I also didn’t want to be the only one who didn’t go. The guys had led us to believe it was just the two of them, but when we got back to the room there were at least 25 other guys.

        I immediately wanted to leave, but again my friends didn’t want to. So I said I’d stay for 30 mins, but then I wanted someone to come back to the room with me. The 2 of the girls and myself started playing board games with a few of the guys who seemed nice, but one of the guys who we had met at the bar kept offering us all drugs. In particular, he was offering drinks and drugs to one of our friends that was really drunk and not playing games. After we played for around 30 mins, we noticed we hadn’t seen the one friend who wasn’t playing for a while. We asked around and someone said she was in the bathroom with the guy who had been offering her drugs. We tried to knock on the door several times because it was locked to get them to open it and check she was okay, but we heard nothing and there was no response. Because she wouldn’t answer, I used a coin to open the door and get in. Essentially, we found her OD’d and the guy was just as fucked but cohesive.

        So we pulled her out of there, and I called an ambulance and put her into the recovery position. While I was doing this and performing CPR the same guy who had given her the drugs came up behind me, and grabbed between my legs. Because I was so focused on my friend, I initially didn’t even register what was happening. It was only after one of my other friends screamed and then shouted at him to get off of me that I realised what was happening. Anyway, after all this I went to the cops and reported the guy. They had me on the phone to the ambulance screaming, they had taken my jeans as well as a statement from me. The shitty part is, because both the other girls were also on drugs, they were worried their statements wouldn’t hold up in court, and that then being intoxicated would be on their permanent records. So even though I was completely sober (I don’t do drugs and I had one drink at the bar), no one would believe my story.

        So sadly, the guy got away with both giving my friend god knows what, and sexually assaulting me.Unfortunately, things like this happen constantly, and because there’s such a strict standard of proof, so many people get ignored.
        It really does build a culture of not wanting to report incidents :(

        #yesmeansyes

        I was on a night out with my friends and a boy that is pretty well known in the shire thought it would be funny to follow me around all night with his mates trying to ‘get in’. When my friends went to the bathroom I was alone and I was pretty wasted at this point. I sat on the chairs waiting for my friends and his friend started filming as he came up and sat next to me. He put his arm around me and then pulled my shirt down and slapped me across the chest exposing me to the camera. I didn’t think much of it because I was in shock but that video was sent to a rugby union group chat to about 100 boys and was posted on a private page on Facebook where these boys could see it, save it and share it around. For around 8 months after this event I would go out and have random guys and girls come up to me saying I’m that girl with the huge boobs that made the guy do it. It killed me a little inside and was a factor as to why I got a medical procedure to get a reduction.

        The video was actually shown to my father on a night out with his mates and one of his friends was in the group chat that it was sent in.

        I had been talking to this guy for a while, he used to come into my local cafe I worked at and we exchanged numbers and started talking. He seemed so lovely and had asked me out a few times, and then bailed last minute…weird. I then went out with some girlfriends to bump into him, he was a lot older than me so I felt intimidated in a way, we spent the night chatting and drinking back and forth, but I really didn’t get a good vibe from him. He offered me a lift home, and as we lived around the corner from each other I didn’t see anything wrong with it, as we arrived at his house (the first stop) he told me that I had to earn my ride home, after being ushered into his house I thought, surely not. I’m a super strong person and very good at telling someone to get fucked, but there was something weird about this. I sat in his bedroom thinking that a 5 minute chat and I’d be able to leave, the Uber was ordered. He’d said he’d gone to get a glass of water, to arrive back naked, he pushed me down on his bed and forced me to orally pleasure him. I tried to push him away but got continuously pushed onto him. I was mortified. I got in my Uber.

        #yesmeansyes

        At the age of 19 living on the opposite side of the world I was sexually assaulted twice in one night.

        It was my last night in Edinburgh, I had lived there for a year and felt completely safe going out. Never once had I experienced anything close to make me feel what I felt that day. I would easily walk home from a club by myself at 4am.

        My friends and I decided to go to a club I’d never been to to celebrate the end of year and a final farewell as we were all going to be splitting up the next day. The only downside of this club was that it was a sandstone building meaning there is no service inside. As the night went on everyone got separated and it was myself and my male roommate. He had to go to the toilet but didn’t feel comfortable with me being alone, so he made me stand outside the door waiting for him, he made me constantly talk/shout to him, so he knew I was there. In less than a minute I was pulled into a dark corridor. I tried fighting him, I tried screaming but nothing would stop him. I had no idea who he was. People would walk past nearby and see my crying but wouldn’t stop to help. Eventually after what felt like forever, he let me go. I sat on the ground crying until my friend found me, it turned out that I had been missing for 40 minutes, they even got someone to check to make sure I hadn’t gone home. He made me feel safe and protected, he knew all the right things to say. He tried making me go home but me being the person I am I pushed my feelings and mental stability to the side and stayed out as I didn’t want to ruin anyone’s night. He didn’t know what happened to me, to him I was just crying on the ground.

        Later that same night I was pulled to a dark corner of the dance floor. At this point I had little to no energy left to fight. This time I was lucky that my friends were there, they pulled me away, not after he’d already hurt me, but he didn’t get as far as the previous guy. I was standing on the dance floor hugging my best friend, with a group of my guy friends surrounding me creating a barrier between me and him until the security kicked him out. My friend then got me out of there. This time I didn’t break down till we got home. I didn’t feel safe anymore, I didn’t want to be alone, but I also didn’t want anyone near me. Oddly enough the safest place I felt was in my roommates’ arm who was a guy. I didn’t sleep the whole night, every time I closed my eyes that was all I saw.

        A couple days after that night one of my friends and a student reached to let me know that they recognised the guy from the dance floor and with my permission they would report him. We found out I wasn’t the only victim; he was kicked out of school (no school in Edinburgh would take him) and now he has a criminal record that will be with him forever.

        The next day if I wasn’t on a plane, I was on the phone talking to my roommate to distract myself. I got on a plane, got home and didn’t tell a single soul and never spoke about it again until I had a breakdown at work almost a whole year after. At a work Christmas party a co-work made me feel uncomfortable, apparently you could physically see me shaking. My boss and manager could see how uncomfortable I was but didn’t put a stop to it till another worker came in and got me out of there. I broke down in the car park, he was the first person I told. I was lucky that the guy had quit so I never had to see him again as I wasn’t sure how I’d feel having to see him so often. I was scared that every time I saw him it would bring back the memories I tried so hard to suppress.

        To this day I’ve only told 5 people.

        The only reason these people know is because I had a breakdown around them, but none of them understand the way I am feeling. They don’t understand that I now have anxiety because of this incident and that I was depressed when I first arrived home. They don’t understand why I hate people touching me or why I don’t go out at night by myself anymore.

        I haven’t told my parents; I’m scared it will change the way they see me. Sometimes I wonder how different my life would be if I didn’t go out that night, what if he didn’t go to the bathroom, what if I wore something else(I was wearing black jeans and a red knit shirt), what if I went home after the first attack. What if, what if.

        At the moment the only silver lining I have is that I’ve become closer to two of the people I told, one being my brother and the other my co-worker. They now notice my subtle changes and are more open with me which I appreciate.
        I will say that writing this has been therapeutic. I think it was because I was putting my feelings and experience down without the pressure of having to tell someone and have them feel sorry for me or be afraid they’d change the way they act around me.

        #yesmeansyes

        I was at a New Year’s Eve party at my own house trying to have a good time with mine and my brothers’ friends when one of them wouldn’t leave me alone and continued feeding me drinks. At some point I was in a state where I couldn’t stand, and the same guy was taking me upstairs in what I thought was a nice gesture trying to look after me and make sure that I was safe, but I was wrong. We got to my room, and he was forcing himself on me and I was trying to push him off and tell him that I didn’t want to do what he was saying we should do but he wouldn’t listen to me no matter what I said or did. This continued and I think what happened next is best left unsaid. After he left my room, he went back to the party with my friends and my brother. I was frozen and had no idea what to do.

        This experience changed me as a person and how I view my own safety as my house and my room was somewhere I always felt safe, but this was taken away from me. I had a lot of rebuilding to do but I couldn’t bring myself to tell my brother, so the friend kept coming around until I finally built up the courage and told my brother a small portion of what had happened, and the friend was cut off completely. This was one of the biggest moments for me as I always felt it was my fault, that if I wasn’t drunk or if I stayed downstairs things would have ended differently and that this awful thing wouldn’t have happened to me. But, my brothers support/love and most importantly the belief that it wasn’t my fault changed things for the better and gave me the peace of mind knowing that it wasn’t my fault and that I shouldn’t be ashamed. Sometimes even now I have trouble in party settings and trusting people but that is something I am working on every day.

        #yesmeansyes

        Around the age of 20 whilst working in a city legal office, I had an experience that whilst not serious in nature, speaks volumes in general. I was asked out to lunch by two of the men I worked for, which I thought was very nice. Whilst at lunch, they started talking about going back to a hotel. It was said in a joking sort of fashion, along the lines of ‘why don’t we go back to a hotel after lunch’. I wasn’t sure if this was a serious suggestion or just mucking around, so I kept laughing and saying ‘sure’. If I had asked them if they were serious and they weren’t, I would have looked a little foolish. On leaving the restaurant, I turned to the left to head back to the city and they both immediately turned right, which was towards the hotel just a few doors away. They appeared to be shocked that I was heading back to the city. Hadn’t I just said I was up for it? So ‘you weren’t serious?’ It was a very quiet walk back to the office. I felt ashamed, humiliated, let down. These were two married guys (both with a history of divorce) and who I had trusted and respected and had thought it was reciprocal. I never felt the same way about them after that and made sure I was never on my own with them again.

        I had been planning to go to Europe for 6 months and was to be resigning soon so this just firmed up in my mind that I wasn’t interested in coming back if asked.

        I also decided this would be my last job in the legal arena.

        Advice

        The silver lining is that you learn not to trust men, particularly those in a more senior position, and to assume the worst, which whilst not ideal, was a form of self preservation. So the silver lining is another valuable life experience learnt.

        There are too many instances of inappropriate comments and touching to mention. Sadly this became an expectation, rather than the exception. There was always a sense in my teen years of the guy only being after one thing, and I think women in general feel a pressure to please.
        Any sort of controlling behaviour/coercion shouldn’t be necessary with a genuinely kind and caring person. Be true to yourself.

        #yesmeansyes

        Rape comes in many forms and means different to a multitude of people. However the universal word of no means no, my story is how people push no to become yes. Persistence to change an answer is not the answer. If you have to ask, beg or tell someone “it will make me feel better” because you’re having a bad day, or a bad thought to make a person give you some action, it’s rape. 
        
        My experience in a past relationship was that sexual acts were used as the bargaining power, when asked originally if I felt up to it, my response would be “not today I’m not feeling in the mood”. His response would be “baby I’m having a bad day, it would make me feel better or more like myself” even after that I would say no, and it would become my fault he was in a depressive state that day, I would be asked until I gave in, and even then when I did, the response would be “you don’t seem into it, you need to be into it so I can feel better”.
        
        No means no. If you get 100 no’s and one yes at the end that’s coercion and rape.

        Introduction

        It was a sunday night and I was sixteen. I was attending a party with most of my girlfriends. There were boys from another local school there that I wasn’t familiar with. Like most parties around this time, I was drinking and planning on having a big night since it was in the middle of school holidays. I met a boy at the party, he seemed pretty nice and he offered to get me a few drinks, since I didn’t bring my own. I thought it was a bit weird that he wasn’t drinking but I didn’t really think much of it.

        Recount

        As the night went on I became more intoxicated and parts of the night are blurry, however I do remember most of it. I was still hanging out with this guy and I consented to kissing him. We had gone for some walks around the property and mingled with the rest of the party. As I became more intoxicated, I began to fall asleep in his lap. At this stage I was pretty drunk.

        We proceeded to go on another walk, but this time it was different. While we were kissing he grabbed my hand and placed it on his crotch. I said I didn’t want to and I explicitly said “No!” a few times, but he didn’t really care. I remember feeling so voiceless and like there was no way out of the situation but to go along with what he wanted me to do. He then proceeded to pull down his pants and he again placed my hand on his penis and started moving my hand up and down. Again I said I didn’t know what I was doing and I didn’t want to do it. He still didn’t care. He let go of my hand, but I didn’t stop because I felt like I couldn’t. I felt really powerless. Eventually, he started complaining because I wasn’t doing it right (it was my first sexual experience, so I obviously had no idea) and again said I didn’t want to do it. He grabbed my hand and “showed me” how to do it. He suggested that I give him head, but this time when I said no and refused, he listened. I don’t know how long this went on for (I was very drunk) but we had moved locations and I was now in a garage, at this point I had built up the courage to stop. When I did, he yelled at me and told me “I couldn’t stop” and it isn’t fair to give someone ‘blue balls’ (I didn’t even know what that meant at the time). Because I wouldn’t touch him again, he made me watch him finish himself off. I couldn’t leave because I was inside the garage. I remember him demanding I find something to clean himself up with.

        Not long after my dad had arrived at the party to come and pick me up. I remember getting in the car and feeling so dirty and upset, but I didn’t understand why. I never told anyone what happened to me because I felt so dirty and ashamed. I also didn’t realise it was sexual assault, because at the time I believed that only included rape.

        The first time I told anyone was two and a half years later. At this point, I still wasn’t aware that it was sexual assault, I just referred to it as a “bad thing that happened to me.” It wasn’t until earlier this year (over four years later), when I read a story almost identical to mine, did I realise I was sexually assaulted. This is only the third time I have told this story.
        
        Revelations:

        This was undoubtedly the worst sexual experience I’ve had but I think it is important to mention some other sexual assault microaggressions that happen ALL the time. Every single one of my female friends have experienced something similar to this.

            Being continually asked to send “cheeky pics” by a boy I liked for years. He knew how I felt and used it to his advantage. Implied if I sent him photos he would reciprocate his feelings for me. I said no and made it clear I was uncomfortable with the idea many times. He wouldn’t take no as an answer, so I eventually gave in since he was persistently asking me. Again in this situation, I felt so pressured into doing it, and thought it would be easier to go along with it, then keep saying no. He ended up asking me a few more times over the next year. He would use the fact that I had sent it before, as an excuse to do it again, even though I said I didn’t want to.
            Men (10+ years older than me) at different workplaces
                Finding out I was a virgin and offering to “change that for me.”
                Calling me pet names and making me walk alone at night with them to take the bins out. He proceeded to ask me intrusive questions, so I mentioned I was still in high school, so he would leave me alone.
                While these experiences, may seem insignificant, dismissing comments and actions such as these, is what contributes to a rape culture society. To transition away from a rape culture society, behaviour like this needs to be called out.

        Advice:

            IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. I spent years blaming myself for so many things i.e going to the party, drinking, taking up his offer for going for a walk, not being more firm when saying no. But what happened to me was not my fault, and it is so important for anybody who was sexually assaulted to know this.
            Any emotion you are feeling is valid. I suppressed all my emotions after that night, because I didn’t understand what happened to me and it seemed so much easier at the time to ignore it, than face it. It isn’t until now, that I can see so many other issues surfaced because I ignored how I was feeling. It is really hard to experience all the emotions that come with being sexually assaulted. This happened to me three and half years ago, but there are still days where I get triggered by something (such as reading similar experiences). I’ve learnt just to accept every emotion and give myself time to feel it.
            Tell someone. This was really hard for me, but it was so rewarding. There is so much fear correlated with talking about sexual assault experiences, particularly when you see how other brave sexual assault victims are treated. I was so scared I wouldn’t be believed or people would look at me differently. But the two people I told were incredible and made me feel so supported. It sounds super cliche, but it felt like a major weight was lifted off my shoulders. So speak up about it (whenever you are ready), I promise it is so worth it.
            Report it. If you are comfortable and it is something you are wanting to do there are a few ways of reporting. I know there is an option to go through the police. I have never spoken to the police about my experience, so I don’t know a lot about this process.
                Here: Police Report for more information about how to undertake this process.
                There is also an anonymous and informal reporting option known as SARO.
                The main difference between the two reporting mechanisms is the latter does not automatically result in a criminal investigation being undertaken.
                Police Report - What happens?
                For reporting through SARO: SARO
            No matter how severe you think it is, it matters.
            Sexual assault is sexual assault, from acts such as rape, to inappropriate touching, staring and comments; it is NEVER okay.
            Please don’t downplay your experience because “it could’ve been worse”. All experiences matter. Your standard of what’s ‘okay’ and ‘not okay’ must be respected.

        Having lived my whole life with anxiety, I can’t really pinpoint exactly where all these feelings and thoughts started. It’s a family gene, one that unfortunately was passed down to me and mostly ruined my life. It was originally a very very mild case, however, as I experienced life and relationships things only got worse as I spiraled into a very serious depression and had a very strong hate for myself during my teens. As I am about to leap into my 20s, I am doing everything I can to make sure anxiety doesn’t hold its power over me, rather I hold my power over IT.

        Youth/adolescence

        My youth and adolescence story was a wild ride. In good and bad ways. My anxiety began to heighten as I became familiar with the structure of my family, this was at the ripe age of 4.

        This time frame also involved copious amounts of time overthinking every situation and conversation possible that I would have to be convinced to go to school or even socialize with my friends.

        I was and still am obsessed with what people think about me, I would and unfortunately still create scenarios in my head that weren’t happening and spiral into an anxiety attack if I thought people were talking bad about me behind my back.

        This stemmed into a very intense fear of confrontation and drama. I fell into a habit where I forgive people too easily and say sorry even if I’m not the one in the wrong.

        This is just a brief summary.

        My relationship with my biological father

        My mother and biological father split when I was 18 months old. From this age, my father figure in my life was my Grandpa.

        Due to my biological father being a pilot, he was moving across Australia. At 3-4 years of age I was travelling to Darwin, Brisbane, Cairns, Adelaide and Newcastle. I was doing all of this without my security blanket, my Mum. My biological father demanded I go without her so that there weren’t any ‘interruptions’ or ‘bias’ conversations going on behind the scenes.

        As sad and as cruel as I may sound, my biological father and his family are the reason I have such a high level of anxiety to this day. They put me in many uncomfortable positions where for example I was the one who ended up having to choose whether to spend Christmas with either my Mum, or them. Being a people pleaser, this did not go down well and I ended up having a panic attack in front of everyone at the age of 6.

        These types of situations resulted in me dreading going to my biological grandmother’s house for family events, to the point where they would have to drag me out of my Mum’s car in the midst of a panic attack. They were strangers to me, they were and still are never involved or interested in my life. Why did I have to go? To keep the peace for my Mum, they would blame her for me being so anxious around them.

        At the age of 11, my biological father, along with his partner and two children (my step-brother and sister) came to my house for a Christmas gathering. During this, he had announced he was moving to Dubai for 10 years as he had a contract with Emirates. I had no bloody idea where Dubai even was!! He then told me it was 15 hours away in another country.

        You may think this would have been a relief for me, but it was quite the opposite.

        After hearing this news, at 11 years old, I had it embedded in my mind that if my own biological father was to leave me this easily, then anyone would leave at the drop of a hat. This is where my attachment issues began.
        Attachment

        Since 11 years old I have had major issues with attachment.

        My father leaving for Dubai set a standard in my head that I would have to go above and beyond for people to even consider staying in my life. Yes, I became that weird, needy, clingy friend that everyone didn’t like. I was so obsessed with people liking and accepting me that I couldn’t get myself to stop.

        I became that easily jealous friend if one of my ‘best-friends’ in primary school hung out with someone else or had a sleepover with another group of friends. I self-sabotaged myself into thinking that I wasn’t good enough for people to be friends with me. I would make Mum buy me the best smiggle rubbers/textas like the cool kids did so other kids would recognise me and want to talk to me. The small things like even a conversation with someone would make all the difference for me.

        Although I am all these things (needy, clingy, desperate for approval), I am also a very bubbly, confident and happy person. As much as it is a shell to protect myself, I do enjoy feeling free of all the anxiety provoked feelings I had for all my life.

        Starting high school was a massive thing for me. I had made a pact with myself that I would be this introverted, people-pleasing person and in that way I wouldn’t cross people’s paths and bother them. Did that work? NOPE. I was used. Used for my kindness and my willingness to please people. I quickly learnt that I had to be myself, but I had no idea who I even was.

        My attachment issues led to many issues with friends during my time in high school, I was dragged into dramas left right and centre because they knew I wasn’t capable of standing up for myself. I apologised and apologised until I had their forgiveness and approval. Even if I didn’t do a thing wrong. Obviously, some of it was my doing, navigating your way through high school, you are going to make mistakes and upset people. This was the harshest reality for me. I couldn’t please everyone.
        Losing power

        Another thing I can’t pinpoint, is the day I allowed my anxiety to take control over me. It was such a slow build up that it ended up all crashing at once.

        At the end of Year 10 I got myself into my first serious relationship. As all relationships do, it began with immense joy and happiness, I felt as though I had found my person, they understood my love language. To keep it short and simple, after about a year of this relationship it was a vicious and toxic cycle of emotional abuse. I had never received emotional abuse before so I wasn’t able to identify it at the time.

        Being gaslighted is probably the worst feeling ever. If you aren’t aware, gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse. It’s the act of manipulating a person by forcing them to question their thoughts, memories and the events occurring around them. It forced me to question a lot more than that thought. I questioned my existence, myself and who I was, I couldn’t understand why I was forced to believe that I was the one that was always in the wrong.

        There were countless times I was left sitting in my room bawling my eyes out because this person would refuse to tell me a time they were meeting up with me because they had better things to do; it would be 11pm and I would have heard nothing. I couldn’t go out with my friends without worrying a snapchat story could trigger them to send me abusive messages and threaten to leave.

        The worst part is, I confided in them. They knew about my fear of abandonment. They used this and treated it like their playground. They found it fun. At least it was for them.

        This toxic cycle resulted in me having around 2-3 panic attacks a week. It became the new norm for me. I thought this is what love was. As much as I had desperately wanted to, I couldn’t find it in myself to let go.

        I remember the conclusion of this relationship.

        I was at dance class with all my friends when I had received the most terrifying message: “we need to talk”. I Immediately knew what this meant. Without even caring about my surroundings I fell into one of the most terrifying attacks yet. This wasn’t any panic attack, it was a full blown anxiety attack. Yes, to me, there is a difference. My anxiety completely took over me and I was laying outside the studio on the concrete shaking in fear of being left and being so worked up that I was vomiting.

        Just a subtle warning that from here it gets a bit deep..

        After this relationship ended, I fell into a massive depression. I thought that no one would ever love me again. I would go on drives in the midst of a panic attack (so dumb Abbey what were you THINKING!!) and try to convince myself not to drive into a tree or off-road. I would find myself home alone and standing Infront of the bathroom cabinet looking at all the pills I could take and it would be over. I often caught myself looking in the mirror, seeing this sad, depressed and helpless human who just wanted to end their suffering. I researched every pill in the cabinet to see which one would have the most effect. But due to my severe phobia of vomiting, I never had the guts to take them (thank goodness), even though my mind was telling me it was the only way out.

        Mum and Dad saw this depression from a mile away and immediately booked me in to get a mental health plan and start seeing a psychologist. I vividly remember her asking me, “Do you have a suicide plan?” and I stopped and thought about this question for a bit. I told her that I don’t have the guts to do it to myself, I just hoped and prayed that somehow I would be involved in some sort of car crash or something of that severity where it was out of my control. But I desperately wanted it to happen.

        This all stemmed from my attachment issues and my anxiety surrounding that. Crazy.
        Attempt at recovery

        To this day I am still working on my recovery. And I am sure I will be for years and years to come.

        To be completely honest, finishing high school was the best thing that could have ever happened to me, I was enrolled in a primary education degree at UOW, I didn’t have to keep toxic friendships and relationships if I didn’t want to. I finally felt a sense of control in my life.

        Everytime I tell someone about how I am studying to be a primary school teacher, they praise me about the holidays I get. But it is soooo much more than that! I want to make a difference, I want to be that teacher that students feel comfortable coming to about absolutely anything. With this though, comes a lot of pressure, mostly that I put on myself to be that ‘perfect teacher’.

        I don’t want to come home from teaching worrying and stressing about certain children who might not be living in stable environments or have a similar experience with anxiety that I had at their age.

        (Have to pull myself up here lol. Read that last paragraph again and tell me I’m not overthinking and creating scenarios in my head ahahaha Will I ever learn? Probably not, but I’m trying.)

        Things that I find helpful to my recovery:

            Surrounding myself with amazing people who genuinely care about me and love me
            Doing all the things that I love (art, dancing, netball, going to the gym, socializing with my friends)
            Being true to yourself and slowly learning that you are who you are and to embrace that
            Scheduling!!!! With a very very mild form of OCD, I love organising and scheduling, it gives me piece of mind and motivation
            Reading – I have always enjoyed reading. Although, I often tend to lean towards the very sad and depressing books, - weirdly – it gives me perspective and allows me to recognise the things I really am grateful for
            Spending time with my family

        Conclusion

        Although my story may not be as interesting as others, it’s my story and in some weird way, I take pride in it. It’s made me who I am today.

        I often used to question why things would happen to me and why I felt the way I felt. But fast forward to today Sunday 11th July 2021, 3:36pm, I have so much to be grateful for and I am so proud of the person I am today.

        I am strong. I am resilient. I am me.

        As cliché as that may sound. It’s true. I’m on the right path and I’m slowly getting better at trusting it.

        I am surrounded by such amazing people. A lot of how I have changed in a very positive way has to be given credit to all the people I work with at my current job. They inspire me every day to have fun, be who I am, and live without any worries. They all have my back and have never had that in a workplace before.

        Even through all my hardships, I am so lucky.`),

        Anxiety

        I’ve probably had issues with anxiety since childhood, but for me the problems became more pronounced in my early 30’s. Perhaps it was an early mid-life crisis. My life had become very centred on work and around this time I started to lose direction and motivation. Many of the things I’d been focusing on and working towards no longer felt so important (e.g. achievements, wealth, possessions, etc). We’d been living abroad for a long while so connection to family and long-time friends had diminished. Career-wise I had been successful but was not really enjoying work anymore. I felt like I didn’t fit in to the industry I worked in, which was very materialistic and money focused. I began to think of it as a means to an end. Something to endure since the money was good and would set us up for happy times later on.

        In the midst of all this I started to experience panic attacks in work settings. The weekly team meeting became a dreaded time of the week. When it was my turn to speak I would find my heart pounding, chest tightening, gasping for air and struggling to get any words out. I guess the pauses were not as long as they felt in my mind. I’m sure they would’ve been noticeable and awkward, although no-one ever spoke to me about it and I never sought help except to try and “fix the problem” myself. I tried some techniques such as self-talk and slow deep breathing, and these helped to some extent although looking back now I guess I was only scratching at the surface.

        I’ve never been diagnosed with clinical anxiety so it’s hard for me to say exactly what I struggle with, but when I scan the literature I recognise various symptoms from generalised anxiety, social anxiety, skin-picking, hoarding, imposter syndrome, and panic attacks. That’s quite a list and I’m probably making it sound a lot worse than it is. Admittedly this has been on a relatively mild level and usually beneath the surface. I’ve never been formally diagnosed or treated, so some may say it’s all in my own head or just a neurotic personality. At times these various forms of anxiety have led to periods of low mood and lethargy, which I recognise now might have been mild depression. And I understand this pattern is quite common for anxiety and depression to go together and feed off each other.

        Reflection

        I’m glad to say I’m in a much better place nowadays. A lot of this could be due to changes in situation, as we relocated back to Australia to be closer to family and a slower pace of life. I’ve shifted to part-time work with a much better life balance including parenting, study and volunteering. I no longer have a feeling of being out of kilter with my values. Many of these things may have been what the panic attacks were trying to tell me in the first place. You wouldn’t think so at the time, but sometimes looking back these dark moments can actually be important messengers, rather than problems to be fixed or avoided.

        Here are some of the things that I find helpful and interesting:

            ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy)
            Yoga (I personally practice Ashtanga Vinyasa yoga)
            Buddhism, mindfulness (I mainly follow Thich Nhat Hanh / the Plum Village tradition).
            Volunteering, service, community

        Of course what works for me may not necessarily work for you, so please be sure to do your own research and find the approach or activity that resonates. I try to be curious and enthusiastic towards all possibilities but at the same time maintain a healthy scepticism, especially of anything that costs a lot of money, makes miraculous claims, or leads you to become dependent on a particular person or system. For some time I was looking for answers, theories or beliefs to cling onto but over time I’ve found more value in regular practices that cultivate a sense of joy, compassion and presence. I try less to fix myself and instead try more to accept myself or simply to return home.
        I’m thankful for this fantastic website and send warm wishes to anyone who may be reading. May we each find our own path to peace. And along the journey may we feel calm in the mind, at ease in the body, connected to dear ones, and at home in the world.

        STRESS

        What is Stress?
        
        Stress is a type of response that we experience when there is a stressor (ie. something we perceive as a threat). Stress places feelings of tension and discomfort on us. These feelings can accumulate over time and cause tiredness and frustration if not dealt with properly.
        
        There are 4 types of stress:
        
            Frustration
            Conflict
            Pressure
            Change
        
        Types of Responses to Stress
        
        Whenever a stressful event happens, our brain perceives a threat and enforces a response to try and deal with this.
        
        Responses may be one or more of the following:
        
            Emotional: crying, depression, anxiety etc.
            Physiological: natural ‘fight or flight’ response accompanied with increased heart rate, tensing of the body, and deep breathing. May feel like ‘butterflies in the stomach’
            Behavioural: engaging in coping behaviours (which is beneficial in managing stress), or giving up on goals, striking out at others, and indulging oneself (which are not beneficial in managing stress)
        
        Stress Management
        
        Learning how to manage stress is a key part of coping in day to day life. There are certainly many different ways you can manage stress, and this can be different for everyone.
        
            Some may manage stress using humour, which increases positive emotions and allows us to shift our focus from feelings of helplessness to feelings of hope. It also allows us to connect with others who may be feeling similar types of stress.
            Releasing pent up emotions through exercise and expressive writing can also be helpful in decreasing the negative feelings that come along with cumulative stress.
            Relaxation techniques such as controlled breathing, muscle relaxations, meditation, and listening to music can help decrease feelings of stress and encourage feelings of emotional calm.
            Learning to change our perception of stressors can affect how we feel during stressful times. This involves repeatedly challenging negative thought patterns, which can be difficult without professional help. This type of stress management is common in psychological treatment.
        
        Social support can also prove to be a major factor in learning how to manage stress. By having explicit conversations with friends, family, etc about your stress, you may be able to receive advice or comfort. Even when not explicitly talking about stress with friends and family, their presence can also provide feelings of comfort.
        Coping
        
        The following are a few ways of coping that may assist in decreasing stress or dealing with the problem at hand.
        
            Problem focused coping: emphasises practical ways of dealing with the problem eg. increase time management for stress surrounding assignments
            Emotion focused coping: attempts to reduce the negative emotions associated with stress eg. self care
        
        Positive Effects of Stress
        
        BUT stress isn’t all bad! Stress helps us build resilience, which promotes personal growth and self improvement. We are forced to learn new skills, reevaluate our priorities, and strengthen as a person. Our experiences of stress improve our coping abilities, allowing us to face future stressors with more confidence.
        
        Despite the sometimes helpful nature of stress, it is only beneficial up until a point. If you feel that stress is impairing your mental health, relationships, or performance at school or work - seek professional help.

        Throughout the decades body image remains to be an important priority for many young adults. This often leads to one keeping a healthy diet and practising daily exercises however in my case, I went far beyond average. In this blog I will take you through my journey of poor health behaviours and how I overcame body dissatisfaction and enhanced my self-esteem.
        
        Social media has been a major determinant of physical and mental health especially in younger users like myself. I have and still expose myself to ‘perfect’ like models and unrealistic body images that appear on social media such as Instagram and Facebook. I am a perfectionist who always found myself aiming for better and for more. I began monitoring my weight and participating in healthy exercising at the age of 15. However as the years went by my goals became unrealistic consequently leading to unhealthy and harmful weight loss.
        
        At the age of 18 I began showing symptoms of Bulimia Nervosa. These symptoms include binge eating, fasting, self-induced vomiting and excessive exercise. On some occasions I would begin my day with a fat burner supplement and eat only at night when I was with my family. Other days would be up to six hours of walking without consumption. Throughout the year I kept these behaviours to myself and would often lie to my friends and family of my consumption. During this moment I found myself more susceptible to illness and experienced episodes of fatigue and weakness. I would often disregard these symptoms and focused on losing weight.
        
        One day my closest friend caught me in an act of self-induced vomiting and decided to take me to the doctors. There we discovered I was underweight. It was that day I discovered how serious my behaviours were and the importance to make a change. I was fortunate to have my friend’s support and efforts in helping me to attain a healthy weight and diet. I hadn’t known that my behaviours were not just a lifestyle choice but a mental illness. Today I try my hardest to avoid the negative side of social media that holds unrealistic body images and expectations. I carry out a healthy intake recommended by health care professionals. I believe I have overcome a major obstacle in my young adulthood and I am proud of myself to make a change for the better of my health.

        In 2019 my doctor diagnosed me with anorexia nervosa; and I felt ill. In my mind the term anorexia stank with rigid criteria: a vain and superficial “teen” with a morbid obsession to squeeze into a size six dress. I didn’t fit the mould. So what was wrong with me? Why was I - an overachieving, intelligent, stubborn and confident 18 year old - so afraid to eat. Unfortunately, it’s taken me over 2 years, 4 hospital admissions and endless appointments to even attempt to work it out.
        
        I always felt a need to achieve perfection. It’s just part of who I am. I progressed through school as a textbook overachiever. Highly confident, headstrong, a little cocky but balanced by my tremendous passion. I devoted every inch of me to school, all in a subconscious effort to mask the pain that was corrupting me.
        
        I grew up in a - you could say - emotionally unstable household. The tumultuous relationship between my family members, and the horrific things i experienced as a child led me to feel a deep sense of loneliness. While I wasn’t diagnosed till much later I believe my anxiety began as a young child. I grew up bitter that I had missed out on the conventional childhood experiences, and that a lot of my days were filled with tears and terror. I told myself that if I could finish school with the best ATAR possible; i could leave home, go to university and begin the life that I had always wanted.
        
        I spent my senior years solely devoted to achieving the best marks I could. I didn’t have a goal, I just knew that anything less than ‘perfection’ was simply not good enough. These unrelenting standards fuelled my anxiety - so badly that it manifested physically. I would get severely sick before my exams and my blood pressure would drop so low that I would often collapse afterwards.
        
        Whilst I achieved a fantastic ATAR, I remember opening it and being so disappointed. It didn’t feel like all my problems had been solved. The pressure spiraled as I was encouraged into a top tier university degree; despite the fact that I was simply so exhausted and depressed from my efforts in school. Taking a break in my eyes would have been considered ‘failure’; so i made the decision to go - this sparked the biggest changes in my life thus far.
        
        I never thought that I would develop an eating disorder. I had always had a healthy relationship with my body, and I absolutely loved food. But that’s the thing about eating disorders, they creep in so quickly and silently that before you even know what’s going on you’re too entrenched. As school concluded in 2018 I considered going on a health kick. I began eating a vegan diet, and exercising a few times a week. Over the course of the coming weeks my vegan diet progressed to a no carb, no sugar vegan diet, and my exercise regime saw me running up to three times a day. In 8 weeks I had lost over 10kilos.
        
        Restriction allowed me to feel an overarching sense of control. maybe if I could completely control what I was eating, I wouldn’t have to worry about anything else that was going on in my life. the less I ate, the less I felt and soon I became completely numb to any emotion or feeling. I was suffering from major depression. I stopped seeing my friends, I dropped out of university, I quit my job and soon my entire life was focused around eating as little as possible, and exercising until my legs wouldn’t move.
        
        My mental state was declining rapidly, but it wasn’t until this was reflected in my physical appearance that anyone seemed to take notice. It’s for this reason that sufferers of eating disorders often don’t receive help until this illness has progressed quite severely. I had started seeing a GP who initially diagnosed me with hyperthyroidism; as my hormones had stopped functioning properly. Symptoms of this illness overlap closely with anorexia nervosa; and my convincing charisma and denial of any dietary issues seemed believable enough.
        
        Anxiety began to take over my entire life. Rules and rituals became outward displays of the internal torture i was suffering. I won’t go into specific detail because I fear this seeming like a book of tips on how to starve, and I worry about the implications of my words on a diet obsessed culture.
        
        Soon enough others started to worry about my ghastly appearance. My eyes were so empty, and my face became hollow. I could barely hold a conversation, and I spoke like a zombie. My mind was so starved, all I could think about was my next meal. Slowly my body stopped devoting the little energy it received to my other functions - my hair began falling out in clumps, I was cold all the time, my fingernails went purple and I was so fatigued. I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, generalised anxiety disorder and depression.
        
        The biggest misconception I have had to deal with is the assumption that my eating disorder began with a desire to be ‘thin’. Before, I simply had no desire to change anything about my body or to lose weight. It was never a driving factor, however treatment providers place such a huge focus on the scale that it does become a maintaining factor. The more emphasis placed on my weight the more it started to concern me. Stepping on a scale became a terrifying process, because if the number went down I was failing those who were trying to help me, but if the number went up I was losing control.
        
        – I also want to place emphasis and advocate for the fact that eating disorders affect people of all genders and body types. You DO NOT have to be underweight to suffer from an eating disorder. Eating disorders are MENTAL illnesses, and they need to be treated as such. –
        
        My anxiety maintained my control; and my control catalysed my anxiety. It was an endless circle of guilt and loneliness; it was a cry for help. I reluctantly continued seeing my GP in defiance of my severe discomfort. – I also want to add a side note here and say that having a good doctor; one who advocates for you, and has taken the time to learn about mental health as a severe and debilitating illness could be the difference between recovering and staying trapped. I am so lucky to have an amazing GP who made the tough decisions for me when i was too sick to think, and consistently stood by me during all of my moments (trust me, there were a lot of moments). –
        
        My GP told me that if I continued with what I was doing, I wouldn’t survive the next few months. but the entire time I was blinded by this mask of invincibility. I felt that everyone was simply over exaggerating and that I would be fine. It’s only in hindsight that I can see how sick I truly was. The depression was so overwhelming that when I felt my heart palpitating after a day of eating nothing, I truly wished I would fall asleep and never wake up. Eventually I did fall unconscious at home and was rushed to hospital. Only a few weeks later I was admitted to a private hospital for treatment.
        
        Over the past year I spent a total of 3 months in a private inpatient facility fed with copious amounts of food in order to restore my weight, and save my failing body. Each day consisted of 7 meals with complete bed rest, many sessions of group therapy, doctors, psychiatrist and dietitian appointments, blood tests and weigh-ins. I was forced to completely surrender my control.
        
        In the hospital I was face to face with all of my biggest anxieties. The more I fed my brain, the more it started to resurface my depression, and my suicidal thoughts. I cried A LOT, and I often relied on medications to calm me down. I lived with 23 other individuals who were also suffering from eating disorders; this was both confronting and rewarding. Some of these people saw me at my absolute worst, my most vulnerable and yet still reminded me every day of my worth. It taught me that I needed to start surrounding myself with people who brought me joy and treated me with respect.
        
        I think it’s important to note that recovering from something as serious as anorexia nervosa is a long process. Not only does it involve restoring physically, and adjusting to a weight restored body, but also rewiring the neural pathways within your brain - essentially reteaching yourself that food is not to be feared. In the beginning a lot of my friends who didn’t understand told me that in order to fix my problem ‘ I just had to eat’. if only it was as simple as that. For me, eating the foods my brain had come to fear brought so much intense guilt and anxiety that I simply couldn’t put myself through it. I couldn’t ‘just eat’ because I was paralysed by anxiety, by thoughts that weren’t rational but seemed so real.
        
        I have been out of hospital since the beginning of March. I am currently engaging in intensive outpatient treatment which involves seeing my dietitian, psychiatrist, gp and psychologist each once per week, as well as up until recently attending a Day program three times a week at the hospital I was treated at. Recovering from an eating disorder is extremely hard. Each day I have to make the choice to recover, and willingly go against my thoughts, fears and anxiety. I believe having access to good treatment is what saved my life. It is important to seek help and support as early as possible.
        
        I now study a degree in medicine and have found a passion in working to become a doctor and one help others in the same position as me. I’m nowhere near recovered; and my anxiety is something that I know I will have to deal with for the rest of my life.
